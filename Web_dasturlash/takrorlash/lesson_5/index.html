        <h2>How To Avoid Wasting Your Most Valuable Online Asset - TIME!</h2>
        <p>
            If you're involved in an internet marketing business, then
            you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1
            enemy - "Time Wasting".
        </p>
        <p>
            What you need to know is that "Time Is Money". And this
            applies even more to the online world, than in regular
            business.
        </p>
        <p>
            You see, anyone can become an online entrepreneur. It
            doesn't involve start-up capital or expensive equipment to
            start. A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.
        </p>
        <p>
            And since cash isn't really a barrier, time-management has
            become all the more critical. Your challenge for success is
            simply to get more done - in less time.
        </p>
        <p class="savol">
            So what are the greatest online time wasters and what can
            you do to avoid them?
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</li>
            <li>Failing to manage your email effectively.</li>
            <li>Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.</li>
            <li>Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="middle">
        
       <h4> Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</h4>
        
        <p>
            This sounds simple. But stop and think how many times you
            retype the same old simple information.
        </p>

        <p> 
            Most people have cottoned on to automating their email
            signature, but you can go far beyond that when it comes to
            communicating words quickly.
        </p>

        <p>
            Get yourself a clickboard or shortcut extender. This will
            enable you to write much faster and prevent you from ever
            having to type the same thing twice.
        </p>

        <p>
            I use this utility http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot , but
            there are lots of other useful typing assistant utilities
            available.

        <h4>Failing to manage your email effectively.</h4>

        <p>
            I know, there's so much spam flying around, but you should
            be attempting to win this war with a few weapons of your
            own installed on your computer.
        </p> 

        <ol>
            <li>
                Make sure you have a working piece of anti-spam software
                set up. Whilst sometimes the wrong messages will get
                trapped, the best software will still remove 98% of the
                emails that you don't want. Make sure they are filtered
                into a junk email file, so you can manually sift
                through them afterwards and pull back any that have
                been incorrectly assumed to be unwanted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set up folders in your inbox and get yourself properly
                organized. I keep a folder for SALES, another one for
                FEEDBACK and others for JOINT VENTURES + many more.
